          - My personal handwritten solutions to the exercises for two courses:
          Calculus and Probability & Statistics.

          I got a lot from junier students and here is what I'd like to share:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          - I vividly recall my initial experiences: my limited English
          listening skills necessitated asking students to repeat their
          questions, yet they displayed patience with me.
          <br />
          - I was deeply moved when some of them sincerely expressed their
          gratitude, recognizing my dedication and effort. This affirmed to me
          that I was engaged in meaningful work.
          <br />
          - It's an unexpected experience for me to still have the opportunity
          to assist others with my limited gifts in Math and its related fields.
          This is an unforgettable memory for me, and I would like to share
          something that I believe is suitable for public viewing, in the hope
          that my past work can give a hand to your journey in gasping relevent
          skills.
